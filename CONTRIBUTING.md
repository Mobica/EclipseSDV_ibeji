# Contributing

Welcome to the Ibeji community. Start here for info on how to contribute and help improve our project.

## How to Contribute

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant Microsoft
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit <https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com>.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

You'll also need to create an [Eclipse Foundation account](https://accounts.eclipse.org/) and agree to the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php). See more info at <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#contributing-contributors>.
